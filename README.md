This is based on the plugin Octoprint-Filament-Scale by @ dieki-n

**THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT WILL NOT WORK AT THIS TIME**

His plugin uses a HX711 directly connected to a Pi. But I'm using a desktop PC running Linux Mint for OctoPrint(Along with Home Assistant). So, I decided to build my scale based on the ESP8266(Wemos D1 Mini). The instructions and code for setting all that up is in the Link above. 

## Setup

Enter the following URL into the Plugin Manager to install.
